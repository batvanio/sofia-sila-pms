# SOFIA: a SiLA PMS Consumer

SOFIA (<b>S</b>iLA-compliant, <b>O</b>pen source, <b>F</b>ast, <b>I</b>ntelligent <b>A</b>pplication) is a reference implementation of a <a href="http://www.sila-standard.org/standards/pms/">SiLA PMS Consumer</a>. Project SOFIA promotes the development of open source laboratory automation tools.

SOFIA enable you to connect multiple SiLA-compliant lab devices to your virtual lab, share and discover SiLA lab devices in your network, execute SiLA Commands (e.g. move a robot, dispense a liquid) and get data (e.g. temperature, status, duration) from your lab devices, and collaborate and share in real time your protocols/methods runs with any other user in your network.

SOFIA is an open source, cross-platform project that was developed as a proof-of-concept for the SiLA core principles (the “Lab of the Future”: a rapid innovation ecosystem connecting devices and people, and exchanging knowledge) and facilitates the future open source development of more advanced functionalities of a SiLA PMS, such as a scheduler, workflow engine, device management, etc. SOFIA could potentially be developed into an on-demand laboratory services hosted in the cloud, where user can run real-time experiments in remote labs across the globe.
