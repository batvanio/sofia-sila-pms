Project SOFIA promotes the development of open source laboratory automation tools.\r\n\r\nSOFIA enable you to connect multiple SiLA-compliant lab devices to your virtual lab, share and discover SiLA lab devices in your network, execute SiLA Commands (e.g. move a robot, dispense a liquid) and get data (e.g. temperature, status, duration) from your lab devices, and collaborate and share in real time your protocols/methods runs with any other user in your network.\r\n\r\nSOFIA is an open source, cross-platform project that was developed as a proof-of-concept for the SiLA core principles (the “Lab of the Future”: a rapid innovation ecosystem connecting devices and people, and exchanging knowledge) and facilitates the future open source development of more advanced functionalities of a SiLA PMS, such as a scheduler, workflow engine, device management, etc. SOFIA could potentially be developed into an on-demand laboratory services hosted in the cloud, where user can run real-time experiments in remote labs across the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n# How to install\r\n...TODO...\r\n\r\n# How to run\r\n...TODO...\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 wega Informatik AG | Erick Bastidas","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
